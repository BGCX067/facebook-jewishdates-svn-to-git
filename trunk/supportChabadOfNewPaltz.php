<h1>Thank you for reading this</h1>
<p>
	I first developed this program because it was exciting. It was a great way to show our Jewish pride in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>
	Then upkeep, bug fixes &amp; new features started taking up a lot of time. But I continued on, not only with this application but also with some of the other Jewish functionality applications, because I now had a user base that wanted these things and I couldn't let you down.
</p>
<p>
	At the same time this is not my main job. In my real life I am together with my wife the director of Chabad of New Paltz. A Jewish Student Center for the Students at SUNY New Paltz. I am the primary fundraiser for the Student Center. A lot of exciting things are happening here and it is a lot of fun.</p>
<p>One of those things is the construction of a building for the Student Center. Which will include a sanctuary, Social hall, Kosher Kitchen, Lounge, Library and ample bathrooms. The structure is up but there is nothing on the inside. This is where we are holding with the funding. we need $100,000 to finish the job. Now I am sure that if I spent enough time going around and explaining the potential of this place to philanthropists I would be able to come up with the money. However with you help we can make this happen in a much more timely fashion. I put in my time to help you, now you please do this to help me.</p>
<p>There are now 5500 users of the Jewish Dates application and almost 5000 users between my other Jewish applications. With the overlap that is probably about 7500. If 1 out of 4 users would give $10 and 1 out of 8 would give $50 we would raise $65,625 enough money to get the project back on its feet.</p>
<p>So if you can spare $10 or if you know someone who would appreciate projects like these who can afford to donate $1,000 to a tax deductible organization. Please go to paypal and show your support for the Student Center and for these Jewish Applications.
