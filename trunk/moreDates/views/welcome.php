	<h1>Welcome to "More Dates" for "Jewish Dates"</h1>
	<h2>
		This is where you can add more events to your facebook Hebrew Calendar.
	</h2>
	<h3><a href="?action=new">Add a Date</a> | <a href="../">Return to "Jewish Dates"</a></h3>
	<p>This brand new feature allows you to add any date to your list.</p>

	<p>Just type in what is pecial about the date - your kids birthdays, your grandfathers Yahrtziet, or your cousin vini's anniversary, etc.<br />
	Then type in the regular (secular) date.<br />
	The application will then add the corresponding Hebrew date plus the next time it will occur.</p>
	
	<p>Once you've added the date. All your friends will be able to see it on their Jewish Dates Home Page, Your profile information tab, Your profile on the boxes tab, On your wall when this special day comes around, and in their home page feeds (if they haven't blocked stories from you ;) )</p>
	
	<p>I am asking everyone to send one dollar for every "Special Date" you add. This will enable me to continue bringing useful Jewish Applications to facebook and beyond.<br />
	$1 dollar is really not much. but if everyone gave 1 then it would add up.</p>
