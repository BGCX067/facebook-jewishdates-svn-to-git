<h1>Thank you for reading this</h1>
<p>
	Jewish Dates is going through some hard times.
</p>

<p>Truth is, everyone is going through hard times, but you are in a <i>unique position</i> to easily help Jewish Dates in a massive way. Being that there are so many users of Jewish Dates, <b>every single dollar</b> each of you donates get compounded and can turn into real capital. If every user will give just five dollars then we will have enough for hosting and development for this and other applications. If you give 18 then you are filling in for anyone who may not be giving.
</p>
<p>Many of you have realized that you no longer receive updates about your friends' birthdays. That is because we lost our hosting and the only host we could afford can not handle sending messages to so many people.
</p>
<p>
Please help me bring back Jewish dates to it former glory and help me create more ways to spread the light of Torah throughout the internet.
</p>
<p>
	Just click that button in the top right, and donate as little as $1 or as much as you want, though paypal <b>or using any credit</b> even if you dont have or want a paypal account.
